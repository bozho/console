	<h1>Opening tabs as another user</h1>

	<p>
		If you configured a tab to run a shell as a different user, you will be
		asked for a username and password before opening a tab. To use a domain
		account, enter your username in the form <i>domain</i>\<i>username</i> 
		or <i>username</i>@<i>domain</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Net Only</b>: this value can be used to create a process that uses a different set of credentials locally than it does remotely. This is useful in inter-domain scenarios where there is no trust relationship.
		The system does not validate the specified credentials. Therefore, the process can start, but it may not have access to network resources.
	</p>

	<p>
		Running a shell as a different user has some limitations:
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>User's HOME env. variable must be explicitly set</li>
			<li>
				If you're running 32-bit Console on 64-bit Windows and attempt to
				run cmd.exe as a shell, a 64-bit cmd.exe will be started and crash.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

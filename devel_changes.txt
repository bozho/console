v2.00
=====

Build 147
=========

- fixed keyboard switching for Vista/Win7

- fixed visible scrollbars on startup with 'Show scrollbars' option turned off

- added support for flat scrollbars

- added icons in the File->New Tab menu (thanks to chrisz for the patch)

- added an option for using a default program icon in the tab menu

- fixed exit codes

- new inject code (many thanks to Jason Hood, creator of AnsiCon http://adoxa.110mb.com/ansicon
  for the code) The new injection code enables running 32-bit shells from 64-bit Console, 
  starting .NET console applications (e.g. powershell) directly, it doesn't use CreateRemoteThread,
  so Windows patches and antivirus software that disables the call should not cause problems. The
  code still hasn't been tested with Vista/Win7 UAC, but it does work for shell processes started
  as another user, so we'll have that feature in Console soon as well.
  
- tabs can now be opened as a different user

- expanded 'trim tab titles' options - you can now show characters at the end of the string

- improved command text resolution for tab titles

- fixed invalid window position after Windows unlock (BR#2912069)

  problems with some GUI apps started from Console)
